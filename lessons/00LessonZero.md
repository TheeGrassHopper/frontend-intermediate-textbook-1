# Frontend Intermediate Textbook
## Lesson Zero
### Taking Notes on [Tonic](https://tonicdev.com/)
You will create a notebook for every lesson. In the notebook, you can play with the examples in the lesson, take notes on things you find online, and leave references for where you learned a particular piece of information.

### Set up your SSH Keys for GitHub
Having to type in your GitHub credentials everytime you push to GitHub from the terminal will get old and time consuming. Follow the instructions at [Generating SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) to authorize your computer, keeping you from having to always type in your GitHub Credentials.

### Server-side JavaScript
JavaScript was born in the browser. It was created by Netscape to add dynamic code inside Netscape Navigator. Nearly all JavaScript was written in, designed for, and limited to the browser. Today is a different time.

Recently, the popularity of JavaScript has exploded, and many coders wanted to use a unified language on the front-end and back-end. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a result of this effort. We will begin our JavaScript journey using `node` in your terminal on your machine (aka. server-side / back-end).

### Using Node
To load a Node.js enviroment, simply type `node` in your terminal to open a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop: or, an interactive JavaScript environment in your terminal). To break out of `node`, you press `ctrl + c` twice. You can also write JavaScript to a file (ex. _apps/01PigLatin.js_) and run the script with `node apps/01PigLatin.js`.
