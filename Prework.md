# Prework

## Codecademy
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a great resource for learning the syntax of different popular laguages, as well as familiarizing yourself with important tools. Make an account and get started coding now. Try to do at lease little bit every day, but don't be afraid to go on a binge. If you pass a lesson and don't fully understand why, that is OK. Your understanding will be cemented in later lessons, as these lessons are simply for exposure to the language. Just pass the tests and move forward.

For your prework (**work done before class starts**) you are to do:

### 1. [Codecademy: Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line)
Without these skills you will fall behind not only in class, but in any developer position anywhere. Complete the 
`Navigation` and `Manipulation` lessons.

### 2. [Codecademy: Javacript](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
Your future bread and butter. **Complete all lessons before `Objects I`**

### 3. Read through all of [Lesson One](https://github.com/mistakevin/HTMLIntermediateSection2/blob/master/LessonOne.md)
You are to read the lesson before the class everytime. We will spend very little time on lecturing, the vast majority being spent on actual coding. You can play with the examples beforehand, but please do not attempt the exercises. You will have some time to work solo on them in class, then you will be randomly paired up to work together with a partner. If there is something in class you feel like you did not fully grasp, do not wait to read on. It may be used differently and/or better explained in the next lesson.

## Bonus!
### 4. [Codecademy: jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)
You want to be a web developer? Welcome to the world of jQuery. This is not a one-off skill, this may be your life when you get that dream job. This is what you can do in your spare time, which, I promise, will be filled with coding-for-fun once you are developer. Also, you'll be asked at your job interviews if you are familiar with jQuery. As a front-end developer, you better say yes.
