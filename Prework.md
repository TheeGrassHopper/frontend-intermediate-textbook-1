# Prework

## Codecademy
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a great resource for learning the syntax of different popular laguages, as well as familiarizing yourself with important tools. Make an account and get started coding now. Do a little bit every day and pace yourself. If you pass a lesson and don't fully understand why, that is fine for now. Your understanding will be cemented in later lessons. Just get through them all. 

For your prework (**work done before class starts**) you are to do:

### 1. [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line)
Without these skills you will fall behind not only in class, but in any developer position anywhere. Complete the 
`Navigation` and `Manipulation` lessons.
### 2. [Javacript](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
Your future bread and butter. **Complete all lessons before `Objects I`**

## Bonus!
### 3. [jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery)
You want to be a web developer? Welcome to the world of jQuery. This is not a one-off skill, this may be your life when you get that dream job. This is what you can do in your spare time, which, I promise, will be filled with coding-for-fun once you are developer. Also, you'll be asked at your job interviews if you are familiar with jQuery. As a front-end developer, you better be.
