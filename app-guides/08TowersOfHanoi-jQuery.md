# Towers of Hanoi GUI

## Spec 1 - Moving the blocks
On `click()` of a `[data-stack]`, `detach()` the `last()` of the `children()` and set it equal to a `var`iable called `block`. Then, when another `[data-stack]` is `click()`ed, check if the `block` variable is assigned, if so, append the `block` to the stack and set `block` to `null`.

## Step 2 - Verify move
Only move the block if the value of the `data-` `block` attribute is less than the last block of the stack, or if the stack is empty.

## Step 3 - Check for win
Create a function `checkForWin()` that checks `.each()` stack and determines if one of the last two stacks has four `[data-block]`s. Run this function after every move. If you won, put the `.text` `'You Won!` inside the `div#announce-game-won` element
