### For Loops
Loops are how you work things done. If I wanted to cycle through this array
`var arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16];`
and return an array with all the items doubled without using a loop, it would end up looking like this
```javascript
var arr2 = [];
arr2.push(arr1[0] * 2);
arr2.push(arr1[0] * 2);
arr2.push(arr1[0] * 2);
arr2.push(arr1[0] * 2);
